    - **Primo flip**: This is a trick where you flip your device upside down and make Igo Primo rotate 180 degrees. To do this, you need to enable the screen rotation option in your device settings and then hold your device upside down while running Igo Primo.
    - **Primo dance**: This is a trick where you make Igo Primo play some music and dance on the screen. To do this, you need to create a folder named "Music" in your Igo folder and copy some mp3 files there. Then, you need to edit the sys.txt file and add these lines:

[debug]
skip\_eula=1
enable\_roadshadow=1
show\_performance=0
reserve\_memory=2097152
cache=262144

Then, you need to restart Igo Primo and tap on the "More" button on the main menu. You will see a new option called "Music Player". Tap on it and select a song from your SD card. You will see Igo Primo playing the song and dancing on the screen.
    - **Primo prank**: This is a trick where you make Igo Primo say something funny or unexpected. To do this, you need to edit the voice files in your Igo folder. You can use a program like Audacity to record or modify the voice files. For example, you can change the voice that says "Turn right" to something like "Turn around" or "Go straight". Then, you need to copy the modified voice files to your Igo folder and select them in your Igo Primo settings.
