- Executing the following code inside Maple: `kernelopts (license [serial]);`[^1^] [^2^]
- The purchase code should be mentioned on the "About Maple" page: (Windows) "Help" > "About Maple". (MacOS) Maple 18 > About Maple 18[^2^]
- Inside either the readme.txt or soapfile.dat files located in: Windows: C:\Program Files\Maple 18\license Mac: /Library/Frameworks/Maple.framework/Versions/18/license/ Linux: $HOME/maple18/license/ For License servers these files can be found in: Windows: C:\Program Files\Maple Network Tools\activate Mac: $HOME/Applications/Maple\_Network\_Tools/activate/ Linux: $HOME/MapleNetworkTools/activate/[^2^]
