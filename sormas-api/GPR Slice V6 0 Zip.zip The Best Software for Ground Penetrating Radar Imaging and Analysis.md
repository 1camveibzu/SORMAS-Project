## How to use GPR-SLICE
 
GPR-SLICE is a user-friendly software that has a graphical user interface (GUI) and a command-line interface (CLI). The GUI allows users to interact with the software using menus, buttons, and windows, while the CLI allows users to enter commands and scripts using a text editor. Both interfaces have their advantages and disadvantages, depending on the user's preference and experience.
 
To use GPR-SLICE, users need to follow some basic steps:

1. Create a project: A project is a folder that contains all the files related to a GPR survey, such as raw data files, info files, processed data files, images, etc. Users can create a project using the GUI or the CLI.
2. Create an info file: An info file is a text file that contains information about the GPR data, such as file name, file format, antenna frequency, sampling rate, trace length, survey type, coordinate system, etc. Users can create an info file using the GUI or the CLI.
3. Convert data: Data conversion is the process of converting the raw data files into GPR-SLICE format, which is necessary for further processing and visualization. Users can convert data using the GUI or the CLI.
4. Process data: Data processing is the process of applying various operations and filters to the converted data to enhance its quality and extract useful information. Users can process data using the GUI or the CLI.
5. Visualize data: Data visualization is the process of displaying the processed data in various forms, such as radargrams, time slices, depth slices, 3D volumes, profiles, maps, etc. Users can visualize data using the GUI or the CLI.

GPR-SLICE has many features and options that allow users to customize their workflow and output according to their needs and preferences. Users can also use various modules and plugins that extend the functionality of GPR-SLICE for specific applications and tasks.
