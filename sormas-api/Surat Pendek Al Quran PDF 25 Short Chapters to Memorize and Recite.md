Surat pendek al Quran are not only beneficial for the reciters, but also for the listeners. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever recites a letter from the Book of Allah, he will have a reward. And that reward will be multiplied by ten. I am not saying that 'Alif, Lam, Meem' is a letter, rather I am saying that 'Alif' is a letter, 'Lam' is a letter and 'Meem' is a letter." (Tirmidhi)
 
He also said: "The best of you are those who learn the Quran and teach it." (Bukhari) Therefore, we should strive to recite the Quran with proper pronunciation and understanding, and share its teachings with others. We should also reflect on its meanings and apply them to our lives. The Quran is a guidance and a healing for the believers. Allah says: "This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah." (Quran 2:2)
