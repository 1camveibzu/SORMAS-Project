The poem begins with a praise of Allah, the Creator and Sustainer of everything. The poet then declares his love for the Prophet (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam), who is his ancestor from the Hashimite clan. He then describes his own spiritual journey, how he attained the rank of Qutb (the axis of the saints), how he received secrets and blessings from Allah, how he became a leader and a guide for the seekers of truth, how he performed miracles and wonders by Allah's permission, how he has knowledge of the past and the future, how he has authority over the heavens and the earth, and how he is a white falcon among the mystics. He then invites his disciples to follow him and drink from his cup of union with Allah. He then warns his enemies and slanderers not to oppose him or harm him, for he is a brave warrior in Allah's cause. He then ends the poem with a prayer for himself and his followers, asking Allah to grant them His mercy, forgiveness, protection, and satisfaction.
 
The poem is considered to be one of the masterpieces of Arabic literature and Sufi poetry. It has been translated into many languages and has inspired many other poets and writers. It is also a source of spiritual guidance and inspiration for millions of Muslims around the world.

## The Qadriyya Sufi Order: A Legacy of Sheikh Abdul Qadir Jilani
 
The Qadriyya Sufi order is one of the oldest and most widespread Sufi orders in the world. It traces its origin to Sheikh Abdul Qadir Jilani, a renowned scholar, preacher, and saint who lived in Baghdad in the 12th century. The order is based on the teachings and practices of Sheikh Jilani, who emphasized the adherence to the fundamentals of Sunni Islam, the love for Allah and His Messenger (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam), and the purification of the heart from worldly attachments.
 
The Qadriyya Sufi order has many branches and sub-orders, each with its own distinctive features and rituals. However, they all share a common bond of loyalty and devotion to Sheikh Jilani, who is regarded as their spiritual master and intercessor. The followers of the Qadriyya Sufi order recite his name and invoke his blessings in their daily prayers and supplications. They also celebrate his birth anniversary (Gyarween Shareef) every month with special gatherings and ceremonies. They also visit his tomb in Baghdad, which is a major pilgrimage site for Muslims.
 
The Qadriyya Sufi order has produced many eminent scholars, saints, poets, and leaders throughout history. Some of the famous personalities associated with the Qadriyya Sufi order are: Imam Ahmad Raza Khan Barelvi (1856-1921), a prominent scholar and reformer from India; Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba (1853-1927), a charismatic leader and founder of the Mouridiyya movement in Senegal; Sheikh Uthman Dan Fodio (1754-1817), a revolutionary leader and founder of the Sokoto Caliphate in Nigeria; Sultan Bahu (1628-1691), a mystic poet and author of many books on Sufism from Pakistan; Moinuddin Chishti (1141-1236), a revered saint and founder of the Chishti Sufi order in India; and Nizamuddin Auliya (1238-1325), a famous saint and successor of Moinuddin Chishti in India.
