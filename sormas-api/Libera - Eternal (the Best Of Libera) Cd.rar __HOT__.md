One of the most remarkable aspects of Libera's music is their ability to reinterpret and reinvent classical and sacred music for a modern audience. They infuse their songs with freshness and originality, while still respecting the tradition and spirit of the original compositions. For example, their version of Ave Maria (in the style of Giulio Caccini) is a stunning rendition that combines the ancient melody with contemporary harmonies and instrumentation. Their version of Sanctus is a powerful and majestic piece that blends Latin lyrics with African rhythms and chants.
 
Another aspect that makes Libera's music appealing is their use of natural and ambient sounds to create a rich and immersive atmosphere. They often record their songs in churches, cathedrals, and other historic locations, capturing the acoustics and echoes of the spaces. They also incorporate sounds of nature, such as birds, water, wind, and bells, to enhance the mood and theme of their songs. For example, their song Far Away features the sound of waves crashing on the shore, creating a sense of longing and nostalgia. Their song Secret features the sound of raindrops falling on a windowpane, creating a sense of mystery and intimacy.
 
Libera's music is not only beautiful to listen to, but also inspiring and uplifting. Their songs convey messages of hope, faith, love, and peace, that resonate with people of all ages and backgrounds. Their music has been used in various occasions and events, such as weddings, funerals, memorials, documentaries, movies, and TV shows. Their music has also touched the lives of many people around the world, who have found comfort and joy in their songs. Libera has performed in many countries and continents, such as the UK, USA, Japan, Korea, Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Canada, Ireland, France, Italy, Germany, Poland, Russia, Brazil, and South Africa.
