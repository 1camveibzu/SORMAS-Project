But ice cream is not only a delicious treat, it also has some surprising benefits for your health and well-being. Here are some of them:
 
## It Stimulates Happiness Hormones
 
Ice cream can make you happy, literally. This is because ice cream contains an amino acid called tryptophan, which is a precursor of serotonin, the neurotransmitter that regulates mood, sleep and appetite. Serotonin is also known as the "happiness hormone" because it can boost your mood and reduce stress. Ice cream can also trigger the release of dopamine, another neurotransmitter that is associated with pleasure and reward. So, next time you feel down or stressed, have a scoop of ice cream and enjoy the mood-lifting effects.
 
## It Relaxes Your Nervous System
 
Ice cream can also help you relax and calm your nerves. This is because ice cream has a cooling effect on your body, which can lower your blood pressure and heart rate. Ice cream can also soothe your throat and reduce inflammation, especially if you have a sore throat or a cough. Ice cream can also help you sleep better, as it contains calcium and magnesium, two minerals that are essential for muscle relaxation and nerve function.
 
## It Maintains Your Bone Density
 
Ice cream can also help you maintain strong and healthy bones. This is because ice cream is rich in calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D, which are all important for bone health. Calcium and phosphorus are the main components of bone tissue, while vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium and regulate bone metabolism. Ice cream can also prevent osteoporosis, a condition that causes bone loss and fractures, especially in older adults.

However, ice cream is not a health food and should be consumed in moderation. Ice cream is also considered an ultra-processed food â meaning that because of the processing methods used to create it, itâs typically very high in calories, fat and sugar[^3^]. Ultra-processed foods can increase your risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease and some cancers[^3^]. Ice cream can also cause tooth decay, cavities and gum disease if you don't brush your teeth properly after eating it.
  
So, enjoy ice cream as an occasional treat, but don't overdo it. Choose natural or homemade ice cream over commercial or artificial ones. Opt for low-fat or sugar-free versions if you are watching your weight or blood sugar levels. And balance your ice cream intake with a healthy diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins and healthy fats.
