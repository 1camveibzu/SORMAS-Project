Architectural character and the history of architecture are two interrelated topics that have fascinated scholars, students, and practitioners of architecture for centuries. How do we define the distinctive features of a building or a style? How do we trace the evolution of architectural forms and ideas across time and space? How do we appreciate the cultural and historical contexts that shape and are shaped by architecture?

One of the books that attempts to answer these questions is *Architectural Character and the History of Architecture* by George Salvan, a Filipino architect and educator who taught at the Baguio Colleges Foundation (now University of the Cordilleras) from 1980 to 1988. The book, published in 1986, is part of a series of textbooks that Salvan wrote for the new ladder type curriculum for architecture in the Philippines. The book covers various periods and regions of architectural history, from prehistoric to modern times, from Egypt to Asia.
 
The book is divided into two parts: Part One deals with architectural character, which Salvan defines as "the quality or qualities that distinguish one building or group of buildings from another." He discusses the factors that influence architectural character, such as geography, geology, climate, religion, history, socio-political conditions, materials, technology, function, and aesthetics. He also explains the principles and elements of design that architects use to create architectural character, such as proportion, scale, balance, rhythm, harmony, contrast, unity, and variety.
 
Part Two deals with the history of architecture, which Salvan describes as "the chronological record of man's achievements in building." He traces the development of architecture from its origins in primitive dwellings and religious monuments to its expressions in various civilizations and cultures. He highlights the major architectural styles and movements that emerged in different historical periods and regions, such as Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Greek, Roman, Early Christian, Byzantine, Islamic, Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Rococo, American, Age of Revivals, Asian, and Philippine. He also analyzes the architectural character of each style and movement in terms of its influences, features, structures, materials, techniques, and examples.
 
The book is richly illustrated with drawings and photographs that help the reader visualize the architectural character and history of architecture. The book also includes a glossary of terms and a bibliography for further reading. The book is written in a clear and concise manner that makes it accessible to students and professionals alike.
 
*Architectural Character and the History of Architecture* by George Salvan is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn more about the fascinating world of architecture. It is a comprehensive and informative guide that covers a wide range of topics and perspectives on architectural character and history. It is also a rare example of a Filipino-authored textbook on architecture that reflects the local context and experience.
