# How to Transfer Your Data and Programs to a New PC with Zinstall Migration Kit Pro 55
 
If you are looking for a way to transfer your data and programs from your old PC to a new one, you might be overwhelmed by the options available. You could try to do it manually, but that would take a lot of time and effort, and you might miss some important files or settings. You could also use a built-in tool like Windows Easy Transfer or File History, but they only transfer your personal files, not your programs or settings. And what if you want to upgrade to Windows 11 or Windows 10 on the same PC, or transfer to a different domain or a cloud-hosted machine?
