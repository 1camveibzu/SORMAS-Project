- Paradise Percussion: This disables the decay of the Percussion completely. This modification is based on Jimmy Smith's album "Groovin' at Small's Paradise" in which he played on a broken B3. This is similar to pulling the 4' or 2 2/3' drawbar out, but is different because the volume is louder and also because Percussion is not routed through the Vibrato circuitry[^1^].
- Percussion On All Registrations: A true B3 only plays Percussion when the B registration on the Upper manual is selected. If this preference is on, Blue3 will play Percussion on all registrations[^1^].
- High resolution/retina-ready graphics: Blue3 v2 boasts exquisite graphics that are fully re-sizable between 70 to 200 percent Ã¢Â€Â“ sure to accommodate most contemporary screen resolutions[^2^].
- Five different tonewheel organs: Blue3 v2 does not emulate a single organ Ã¢Â€Â“ rather, it distinctly models five different tonewheel organs; A100 (1960), B3 (1954), B3 (1958), C3 (1969) and L100 (1968)[^2^]. Each organ has its own unique tonal characteristics and quirks that are faithfully captured by Blue3 v2.

Blue3 v2 is a powerful and versatile plugin that can produce authentic and warm organ sounds for any genre of music.

One of the most important aspects of any tonewheel organ plugin is the rotary speaker simulation. The rotary speaker is a device that consists of a rotating horn and a stationary woofer that creates a distinctive modulation and Doppler effect on the organ sound. Blue3 v2 includes Spin, a separate plugin that contains Blue3's Tube Overdrive and Rotary Cabinet simulations. Spin offers three classic rotary speaker models: 122, 147 and "high power" custom. You can adjust the rotary speeds, acceleration and deceleration, microphone spread, distance and balance, horn diffusers, front stop and Memphis control. You can also choose from three tube overdrive simulations: 40 watt rotary speaker, high gain British guitar amp and custom overdrive. You can mix and match the overdrive and cabinet models to create your own unique combinations.
 
Another important aspect of any tonewheel organ plugin is the tonewheel set. The tonewheel set is the collection of metal wheels that generate the electrical signals that are shaped by the drawbars and filters to create the organ sound. Different tonewheel sets have different harmonic profiles and levels of leakage and crosstalk. Blue3 v2 offers 30 tonewheel sets from vintage A100, B3, C3 and L100 instruments. You can select the tonewheel set from the Edit page, where you can also adjust the tonewheel leakage, crosstalk and flutter. You can also create your own custom tonewheel sets by adjusting the 6 way tonewheel scaling and the drawbar output levels.
 
Blue3 v2 also offers a lot of flexibility and control over the other aspects of the organ sound, such as the vibrato/chorus scanner, the percussion & vibrato scanner controls, the manual taper & volume robbing, the key click and key contact simulation, the 9 contact key and busbar simulation, the adjustable 3 band output EQ and more. You can access these settings from the Edit page or the Settings dialog. You can also use MIDI controllers to control various parameters of Blue3 v2, such as the drawbars, the rotary speed, the percussion settings and more. You can assign MIDI controllers from the Settings dialog or use MIDI learn by right-clicking on any parameter.
