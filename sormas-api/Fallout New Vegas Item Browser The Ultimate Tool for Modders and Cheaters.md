## How to Use the Fallout New Vegas Item Browser
 
The Fallout New Vegas Item Browser is very easy to use. You can find it at [www.falloutnewvegasitembrowser.com](https://www.falloutnewvegasitembrowser.com). Once you open the website, you will see a list of all the items in the game, divided into categories such as weapons, armor, ammo, etc. You can click on any category to expand it and see the subcategories and items within it.
 
You can also use the search bar at the top of the page to type in any keyword or phrase related to an item. For example, if you type in "laser", you will see all the items that have "laser" in their name or description. You can also use advanced search options such as filters and operators to narrow down your results. For example, if you type in "laser +damage > 20", you will see all the laser weapons that have a damage value higher than 20.
 
When you click on any item in the list, you will see a detailed page with all the information about that item. You will see its name, image, description, stats, effects, value, weight, base ID, and more. You will also see a list of related items that are similar or compatible with that item. For example, if you click on a laser rifle, you will see a list of mods that can be attached to it, such as scopes or beam splitters.
 
You can also use the compare feature to compare up to four items side by side. You can select any items from the list and click on the compare button at the bottom of the page. You will see a table with all the stats and attributes of each item. You can use this feature to decide which item is better for your playstyle and preferences.
