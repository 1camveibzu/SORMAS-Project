But what if you want to learn more than just raking? What if you want to master the art of single pin picking (SPP), which involves lifting each pin individually until it reaches the shear line? This technique requires more skill and patience, but it also gives you more control and precision over the lock. SPP can also help you defeat locks that are resistant to raking, such as those with security pins or complex keyways.
 
That's where Mike Gibson Dr Bint Lock Picking Detail Overkill comes in handy. In his book, he teaches you how to combine raking and SPP to achieve the best results. He calls this technique "cheating", but it's really just a smart way to use both methods to your advantage. Here's how it works:

1. Start by raking the lock a few times to see if you can get lucky and set some pins.
2. Then, switch to your SPP pick and gently probe each pin, starting from the back of the lock. Feel for any pins that are binding or resisting your pick.
3. Lift each binding pin until you hear or feel a click, which means it has reached the shear line. You may also feel a slight rotation of the plug as you set each pin.
4. Repeat this process until all pins are set and the lock opens.

This technique allows you to use raking as a shortcut to set some pins quickly, and then use SPP to finish off the rest. It can save you time and frustration, especially if you are dealing with a difficult lock. Mike Gibson Dr Bint Lock Picking Detail Overkill explains this technique in detail, along with many other tips and tricks that will make you a better lock picker.
