# VRS TacPack: A Tactical Combat System for FSX/P3D
 
VRS TacPack is a modification for Microsoft Flight Simulator X (FSX) and Prepar3D (P3D) that adds realistic weapons, radar, and IFF systems to compatible aircraft. It also allows users to spawn AI refuelers, drones, aircraft carriers, and other objects directly into the simulation. VRS TacPack is designed to work with TacPack-Poweredâ¢ aircraft, which are built using the TacPack Software Development Kit (SDK). The SDK enables third-party developers to integrate TacPack features into their aircraft without paying any royalties or fees.
 
In this article, we will review some of the main features of VRS TacPack and how to download and install it. We will also provide some links to popular TacPack-Poweredâ¢ aircraft that you can use to enjoy the full potential of VRS TacPack.

## Features of VRS TacPack
 
VRS TacPack offers a range of features that enhance the realism and immersion of FSX/P3D military aviation. Some of these features are:
 
- **Lethal Tactical Systems:** VRS TacPack adds realistic weapons such as guns, rockets, missiles, bombs, and torpedoes to compatible aircraft. These weapons have accurate weights, physics, performance, effects, and lethality envelopes. You can use them to engage air and ground targets, evade air defenses such as SAMs and AAA, or try to penetrate enemy airspace. You can also use countermeasures such as flares and chaff to decoy incoming threats. All systems work in both single and multi-player modes.
- **Radar and IFF:** VRS TacPack adds realistic radar and identification friend or foe (IFF) systems to compatible aircraft. You can use the radar to scan for targets, lock on them, and guide your weapons. You can also use the IFF system to identify friendly and hostile aircraft based on their transponder codes. The radar and IFF systems are integrated with the fire control system (FCS) of each aircraft, which determines the optimal weapon selection and release parameters.
- **AI Objects:** VRS TacPack allows you to spawn various AI objects into the simulation via a handy in-game menu. You can spawn refueling tankers that you can rendezvous with and refuel your aircraft in mid-air. You can also spawn drones that you can use as target practice or as wingmen. You can also spawn aircraft carriers with pitching and rolling decks that you can land on and take off from. You can also spawn SAM sites that will launch missiles at you if you enter their range.
- **TacPack SDK:** VRS TacPack comes with a software development kit (SDK) that enables third-party developers to create TacPack-Poweredâ¢ aircraft. The SDK provides documentation and examples on how to integrate TacPack features into any FSX/P3D aircraft model. The SDK is royalty-free and license-free, meaning that developers can sell their TacPack-Poweredâ¢ aircraft without paying any fees to VRS.
