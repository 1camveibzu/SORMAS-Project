# TMNT 2007: A Fun but Flawed Brawler for PC
 
TMNT 2007 is a video game based on the animated movie of the same name, featuring the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in a new adventure. The game was released for various platforms, including PC, in 2007. The PC version was cracked by SKYFLAT, a group of hackers who bypassed the game's copy protection and made it available for free download.
 
The game is a mix of platforming and combat, similar to the Prince of Persia series. The player can control any of the four turtles, each with their own unique abilities and weapons. The game also features co-op and versus modes, as well as challenge maps and unlockable content. The game's graphics are colorful and smooth, and the voice acting is done by the same actors from the movie.

However, the game also has its share of problems. The game is very short and easy, as the player cannot die or fail. The game also lacks depth and variety, as the levels are linear and repetitive, and the enemies are bland and weak. The game's camera is often problematic, especially during platforming sections. The game also suffers from technical issues, such as bugs, glitches, and crashes.
 
TMNT 2007 is a game that may appeal to young fans of the movie or the turtles, but it is not a very satisfying or challenging experience for more seasoned gamers. The game has some fun moments and cool animations, but it is ultimately a shallow and flawed brawler that does not live up to its potential.
  
The game follows the plot of the movie, but also adds some original scenes and characters. The game is divided into four chapters, each focusing on one of the turtles and their personal struggles. The game also features flashbacks to the turtles' early days as ninjas, when they were trained by their master Splinter. The game's story is narrated by Casey Jones, a friend and ally of the turtles.
 
The game's main mode is the single-player campaign, where the player can switch between any of the four turtles at any time. Each turtle has their own special moves and combos, as well as a rage meter that fills up as they fight. When the rage meter is full, the turtle can unleash a powerful attack that can damage multiple enemies. The game also allows the player to use teamwork moves, where two or more turtles can combine their skills to perform a special attack.
 
The game also features other modes, such as co-op and versus modes for the PSP and DS versions, where up to four players can join forces or compete against each other. The game also has 16 unlockable challenge levels, where the player can test their skills in various tasks and mini-games. The game also has a variety of collectibles and unlockables, such as concept art, videos, cheats, and costumes.
  
The game received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its platforming and graphics, but criticized its combat, camera, and difficulty. The game has an average score of 61% on Metacritic, based on 40 reviews for the Xbox 360 version. [1] Some of the positive reviews came from Game Informer, which gave the game a 7.5 out of 10, saying \"TMNT is a fun game that does a great job of capturing the spirit of the movie and the turtles themselves.\" [2] and GameZone, which gave the game an 8 out of 10, saying \"TMNT is a solid action game that will appeal to fans of the movie and the comic book series.\" [3]

However, some of the negative reviews came from IGN, which gave the game a 6 out of 10, saying \"TMNT is a decent attempt at creating an action platformer that falls short due to a lack of polish and originality.\" [4] and GameSpot, which gave the game a 6.4 out of 10, saying \"TMNT is a simple beat-'em-up that doesn't have much going for it beyond its license.\" [5] The game was also criticized for being too easy and short, as well as for not having a multiplayer mode for the console versions.
 
TMNT 2007 is a game that may appeal to young fans of the movie or the turtles, but it is not a very satisfying or challenging experience for more seasoned gamers. The game has some fun moments and cool animations, but it is ultimately a shallow and flawed brawler that does not live up to its potential.
